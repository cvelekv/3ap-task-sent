## Background story 🗿
You have been hired by a startup company fresh in the music field 🎵 to create a single page app (SPA), MusicBox, which consumes Spotify's [WebApi](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). The SPA has to be fresh and responsive.

## The🎵Box🎁
The SPA allows the user to search for artists, view artist information, their albums and album tracks. The user can also
see the hottest Spotify releases, previous artist searches and viewed albums. The SPA also allows the user to set a few
preferences.

## Preconditions 🏋
In order to consume the API, the candidate must follow the [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).
Besides the WebApi, the [Endpoint reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) is a good place to start.

## Assignments 🎓

### 📝 Server
With each request to the API, an access token needs to be provided. MusicBox is a registered application with Spotify and client credentials
(id and secret) will be provided to the candidate upon request. One of the components of MusicBox should be a simple server.
The server should authenticate via the client credentials with Spotify and use the access token.
The server can be developed in any technology stack (e.g. node+express) and should be as simple as possible.

For more information about client credential flow can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow).

### 📝 SPA
The SPA should be developed in either Angular (the new one, not AngularJS 😉), React or Vue. The SPA should have a fresh and responsive design.
In order to keep things simple, the candidate is asked to use as few third party libraries as possible, but this is not a must.

The candidate can use a starter pack to ease the development process and reuse best practices, such as:
- [ng-cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

### Functionality

#### 🔍 Search
The user can search an [artist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/) or artists by first or last name.

#### 😎 Artists
Once the user successfully searched for an artist or artists, the user can select an artist
and view the [artist's albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums).

#### 💿 Albums
Albums should display the name, type (one of album, compilation or single) and the appropriate image.
Each album has a list of contributors, other artists who worked on the piece. The user can select those as well.

#### 👓 Recently Viewed
Each time the user selects an album, this album should be stored for easier access later. This list could be displayed as a footer.
The albums should be displayed as thumbnail images. The candidate can provide another user experience in regards to the recently viewed.

#### ⚙ Settings
MusicBox comes with several predefined settings:
- number of visible recently viewed albums
- number of stored recently viewed albums
Changing any of these should reflect the user experience accordingly.

#### 🏆 BONUS
The candidate can provide a new functionality for MusicBox that the client has not requested and based on what Spotify already provides.
The candidate can provide reasonable unit and e2e tests.

### Possible look and feel
**_This is a POSSIBLE look and feel. The candidate is not restricted to follow nor is it requested from the candidate to take this template and solve the assignment with it in mind!!_**
